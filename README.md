Project Title : Trimboli_Portfolio

This project was deigned to let you know a little bit more about me, to show you a portfolio of my work, and to provide a means of contact if you would like to hire me. 

There are several visual elements (photos) on this webpage.  You can view them all both on the site, as well as through github in the assests folder, under images. 

Bootstrap was very helpful in getting the layout looks that I desired.  I also went through and commented out what was what in my code to the best of my ability in order to make things clearer. 

w3schools.com is another great resource for answers to your questions!


Navigate through the tabs on the navbar to move through the different pages.
